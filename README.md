## Overview

### Setup

## Feature extraction

This part is divided into 2 parts, decompilation and features extraction.
During the decompilation part,the programme is going to decompile all the given apk.
During the feature extraction part, the programme will look into the decompiled code to extract feature.

### Setup

Open the file ``/FeatureExtraction/featureExtraction`` and change the value of ``DIR_PATH`` 
by the absolute path the directory. If you are using windows change the ``IS_WINDOWS`` to ``True``.
You will also need to download the data base from here: 

### Usage

To run the feature extraction you can run the following command:

```
python FeatureExtraction.py ./DataBase ./dest ./feature
```
This will decompile all the DataBase into the 
./dest directory and all the features will be saved in the ./features directory. 
Once you have decompile the apk you can change the value ``DECOMPILE_APK`` to ``False`` to skip the decompilation.


## Classification

To run the classification on a feature set, you can run the following command:

```
Classifier.py ./feature/train_ANDROID_1629097675.8447692 ./feature/test_ANDROID_1629097675.8447692 ./DataBase/train ./DataBase/test
```
First parameter must be the path to your training feature set directory 
Second parameter must be the path to your test feature set directory
Third parameter must be the path to your database train directory
Fourth parameter must be the path to your database test directory
